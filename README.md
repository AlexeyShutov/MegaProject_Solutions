- [<b>Fibonacci Number Sequence: </b>](Numbers/Fibonacci.java) Enter a number and have the program generate the Fibonacci sequence to the Nth number.
- [<b>Pi to the Nth: </b>](Numbers/Pi_to_the_Nth.java) Queries the user on how many places to round PI to and then provides the correct rounding result from 1-18 places
- [<b>e to the Nth: </b>](Numbers/e_to_the_Nth.java) Queries the user on how many places to round e to and then provides the correct rounding result from 1-18 places
- [<b>Binary-Decimal Converter: </b>](Numbers/binary_decimal_conversion.java) A converter to convert a decimal number to binary or a binary number to its decimal equivalent.
- [<b>Factorial Finder: </b>](Numbers/factorial_finder.java) The Factorial of a positive integer, n, is defined as the product of the sequence n, n-1, n-2, ...1 and the factorial of zero, 0, is defined as being 1.
- [<b>Happy Number Finder: </b>](Numbers/happy_numbers.java) A happy number is defined by the following process. Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers, while those that do not end in 1 are unhappy numbers.
- [<b>Get the Next Prime: </b>](Numbers/next_Prime.java) Gives the user the next prime number until user specifies to stop
- [<b>Prime Factorization Finder: </b>](Numbers/prime_Factorization.java) The user enters a number and the program finds all Prime Factors (if there are any) and displays them.
